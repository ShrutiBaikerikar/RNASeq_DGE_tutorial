# RNA-SEQ Differential Gene Expression Analysis of COVID-19 Infected Pancreas Cells

This repository comprises a general workflow for Differential Gene Expression using RNA Sequencing data using HISAT2 and DeSeq2. 

The dataset used in this workflow is GSE159717 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE159717) which can be downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). 

The dataset GSE159717 involves RNA Sequencing on samples of human pancreatic islet cells obtained from patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
This study was conducted by Müller and colleagues involving Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany and multiple institutions. Please check this link (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33536639/) for the full affiliation list.

The purpose of this workflow is to highlight the general steps involved in Differential Gene Expression Analysis. We will be exploring differential gene expression in uninfected and infected (with or without remdesivir), cultured human pancreatic islet cells.

At the moment, the repository contains only Shell scripts used in the workflow. It will be updated soon with the rest of the details.
